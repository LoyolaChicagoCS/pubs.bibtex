pubs.bibtex
=============

This is a work in progress to gather all publications from the CS department. It starts
from BibTeX files that George and Konstantin have maintained for their own work and various
proposals.

There are also some non-LUC publications here. At some point, I will separate these into
"luc" and "related" folders so we can distinguish the two.

All in the department are welcome to provide their resources in .bib format for inclusion.
